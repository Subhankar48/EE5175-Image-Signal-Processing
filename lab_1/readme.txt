The Jupyter notebook already has the generated results. 

It assumes that the image files are present in the same directory
as the notebook.  

All the results can be regenerated by running all the cells again.
The results are with respect to the default parameters mentioned. 

Reslts for different set of parameters can be obtained by making the
appropriate changes in the parameters section in the notebook.

To ensure that the markdown labels for zoom in and zoom out still
make sense after changing parameters, while setting a_vals=(a1, a2)
ensure that a1<1 and a2>1. This is not important for the code to run 
properly but just for the markdown labels to make sense.
